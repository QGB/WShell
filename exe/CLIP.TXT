             CLIP - Copy the specified text file to the clip board

 ==============================================================================

 As a relative "old-timer" in the computer world, I am still partial to
 running DOS or "console" applications in Windows 95/98/NT.  I almost
 always have several 4DOS boxes open at the same time.

 Part of my job is to correspond with a number of programmers that use my
 company's product.  And as a result, I email a lot of source code examples
 and other often used text files.  I wrote CLIP so that I could quickly copy
 a text file from a command prompt into the clipboard for pasting into
 Eudora, WinCIM or Microsoft Word.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To copy a text file to te clipboard, simply type:

   CLIP filename.txt

 and the file will be copied into the clipboard as a text file.  You can
 then simply paste it into any application that supports the Windows
 clipboard.

 To read any text in the clipboard and write it to a text file, simply
 type:

   CLIP filename.ext /r

 and any text data in the clipboard will be written to the specified file.
 If no text data is present, the file is not created.  If the file already
 exists, it will be overwritten.

 CLIP also supports redirection and pipes.  You can copy the output of any
 applications that writes to STDOUT into the clipboard:

   DIR | CLIP.EXE

 Or simply redirect text:

   CLIP < filename.txt

 You can also clip bitmap (.BMP) files to the clipboard:

   CLIP filename.bmp

 Any file with a .BMP extension is assumed to be a standard Windows .BMP file.
 Otherwise a text file is assumed.
